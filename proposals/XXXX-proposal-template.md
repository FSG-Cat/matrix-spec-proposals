# MSC0000: Policy Documents

Currently, the SCT can cite inaccessible documents in review,
feedback, and proposals themselves. This is done for a variety of
reasons, ranging from security to policy development.

When an inaccessible document is cited, it provides the SCT an
unfalsifiable argumentation and inaccessible authority that stops
feedback, or defences of proposals, reviews, and proposals themselves
from receiving fair evaluation and scrutiny. This mechanism provides
an unjust asymmetry between the SCT and other contributors because it
allows members of the SCT to use inaccessible authorities to dismiss
or raise concerns without scrutiny, and without any means of
verification.

We propose that documents that are cited either in a proposal
or during any part of MSC review MUST be as accessible as the MSC
itself. As the MSC process is open to everyone, this effectively means
documents will be publicly available.

We then provide a pathway for evaluation of security, safety, or other
sensitive documents by a Matrix governing board working group.

## Proposal

We propose that feedback, review, and proposals MUST NOT refer to
documents, ideas, processes that are not publicly available for
review and scrutiny except in extenuating circumstances defined below
(for example, a security issue).

### Providing a process for appealing to inaccessible authority

The SCT will still have the discretion to appeal to an inaccessible
authority, however they MUST first seek approval from the
"inaccessible authority evaluation working group" so that the claims
can be scrutinised BEFORE they are used in a review. The document in
question MUST be made available to the working group for scruitiny so
that the claims are verified. If the document is not made accessible
to the working group, and the information is presented in an
unverifiable way, then the working group MUST reject the appeal.

This process does not exist to determine whether an appeal to
inaccessible authority is justified, it is to obtain access to any
documentation, evaluate the claims, and verify the authority.

This mechanism is deliberately proactive so that appeals to
inaccessible authority cannot be made in excess or under the
radar. Which would wear down the governing board's transparency
mechanism, as they would otherwise have to chase down each claim and
investigate in reaction. Which would again provide an asymmetry in the
SCT's favour.

## Potential issues

This new process is in theory more complicated since you have to know what
document your going to appeal to when trying to nix something on the basis of violating a policy.
The problem with this argument is that you should know what document
your invoking when nixing something based on a policy.

## Alternatives

*This is where alternative solutions could be listed. There's almost always another way to do things
and this section gives you the opportunity to highlight why those ways are not as desirable. The
argument made in this example is that all of the text provided by the template could be integrated
into the proposals introduction, although with some risk of losing clarity.*

Instead of adding a template to the repository, the assistance it provides could be integrated into
the proposal process itself. There is an argument to be had that the proposal process should be as
descriptive as possible, although having even more detail in the proposals introduction could lead to
some confusion or lack of understanding. Not to mention if the document is too large then potential
authors could be scared off as the process suddenly looks a lot more complicated than it is. For those
reasons, this proposal does not consider integrating the template in the proposals introduction a good
idea.

## Security considerations

Security considerations are covered in the [proposal](#proposal) section.
